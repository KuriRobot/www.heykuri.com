                  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
                  <p>Last updated: December 19, 2017</p>
<p>Welcome to <a href="/">www.heykuri.com</a> and the websites and services of Robert Bosch Start-up Platform North America LLC, Series 1, dba Mayfield Robotics (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This page explains the terms by which you may: (i) access and use www.heykuri.com and any other website on which we post this Terms of Service Agreement (“Websites”); (ii) pre-order, purchase and use the Kuri personal robot (together with Kuri Software, defined below, “Kuri”); and (iii) access and use the Kuri mobile application and software (the “App”) ((i) – (iii) collectively, together with any related software, hardware, documentation and hosted services, the “Service”). By clicking “I Agree,” or the like, indicating acceptance electronically, or by accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and you agree to be bound by this Terms of Service Agreement (“Agreement”) and to the collection and use of your informati on as set forth in our Website Privacy Policy and Privacy Statement for Kuri Device and Service both currently available at www.heykuri.com/privacy (together, the “Privacy Policies”), whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. Company reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to this Agreement and will provide notice of these changes as described below. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service (“Users”).</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.</p>
<p><strong>1. ORDERING KURI</strong></p>
<p>A. Offer. Company may provide you with the opportunity to reserve and pre-order Kuri. Kuri devices made available for reservation and pre-order are not offered for sale by Company. Reserving a Kuri and placing a pre-order does not create a contract of sale; rather, you are making an offer to Company to purchase Kuri, subject to this Agreement (each offer, a “Pre-Order Reservation”).</p>
<p>B. Prices and Payment Terms. All descriptions of Kuri, prices, and payment terms posted on our Websites and materials are within our sole discretion and subject to change at any time, with or without notice. The price charged for Kuri and payment terms will be the price and payment terms in effect at the time the order is placed and will be set out in your order confirmation email. Price increases will only apply to orders placed after such changes. Posted prices do not include taxes or shipping and handling charges. All such taxes and charges will be added to your merchandise total and will be itemized in your shopping cart and in your order confirmation email. We are not responsible for pricing, typographical, or other errors in any offer by us and we reserve the right to cancel any orders arising from such errors. Payments for Kuri are processed through one of our third-party payment service providers (each, a “Payment Service Provider”). Payment must be received by our Payment Service Providers before our acceptance of an order. Each of our Payment Service Providers accepts the payment methods listed below. For all purchases, our Payment Service Providers will collect your payment method details and charge your payment method in connection with an order. You represent and warrant that (i) the account, order, and payment method information you supply to us or our Payment Service Providers, as applicable, is true, correct and complete, (ii) you are duly authorized to use such payment method for the purchase, (iii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your payment method company, and (iv) you will pay all charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including all applicable taxes. If any of your account, order, or payment method information changes, you agree to promptly update this information, so that we or our Payment Service Providers may complete your transactions and contact you as needed. We are not liable for any unauthorized use of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method by a third party in connection with your use of our Service.</p>
<p>Payment Methods:</p>
<p>Credit cards accepted:</p>
<ul>
<li>American Express</li>
<li>Discover</li>
<li>MasterCard</li>
<li>Visa</li>
<li>Diner’s Club</li>
<li>JCB</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not accept:</p>
<ul>
<li>CODs</li>
<li>Layaway Plan</li>
<li>Personal Checks</li>
<li>Money Orders</li>
<li>Credit card gift cards from Visa, MasterCard and American Express</li>
</ul>
<p>C. Credit or Debit Card Charges. When you place your Pre-Order Reservation, our Payment Service Provider will obtain an authorization hold from your bank or credit card company at no charge and this authorization may stay open until the charge is actually made. This hold is released from the account depending on your bank’s specific policies. Our Payment Service Provider may obtain an additional authorization from your payment card company to confirm the necessary funds are available to purchase Kuri. Later, when Kuri is offered for sale, Company may accept your offer to purchase Kuri, subject to this Agreement. At that time, our Payment Service Provider will charge your payment card and ship Kuri. If you are using a credit card gift card, the funds may immediately be deducted from your gift card account when you place your Pre-Order Reservation.</p>
<p>D. Shipping. If Company provides an expected shipping date, such date is an estimate, cannot be guaranteed and is subject to change. Company shall not be liable for any change in such expected shipping date. Kuri devices reserved as Pre-Order Reservations are not immediately available for shipping, and therefore, will not ship until a later date. Your reserved items should arrive by the expected delivery date, which is shown at checkout, however such expected delivery date is an estimated date and cannot be guaranteed. You will be notified via email if there is an issue that will delay your delivery beyond the expected delivery date. Your billing and shipping addresses may be different. You will pay all shipping charges specified during the ordering process. Title and risk of loss pass to you upon our transfer of Kuri to the carrier/delivery. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to ship Kuri to you by the scheduled delivery dates, but we are not liable, under any circumstances, for any losses, damages or penalties due to any delays in shipments or deliveries.</p>
<p>E. Cancellation. You may cancel your pre-order at any time prior to shipment by emailing our customer service department at support@heykuri.com. If you cancel, you will not be charged and if you paid a deposit, such deposit will be refunded to you. Company reserves the right to cancel or refuse any order for any reason at any time prior to shipment, including after an order has been submitted, whether or not the order has been confirmed. We may attempt to contact you if all or any portion of your order is cancelled, or if additional information is needed to complete and accept your order.</p>
<p>F. Return Policy / 30-Day Money Back Guarantee. We want each of our customers to be excited about Kuri, and are pleased to offer a 30-Day money-back guarantee. If you are not 100% satisfied, we will accept a return of Kuri for a refund of your purchase price, less the original shipping and handling costs, provided such return is made within thirty (30) days of Kuri activation (in the App) and provided such Kuri is returned in its original condition, as determined in our sole discretion. To return Kuri, you must contact our customer service department at support@heykuri.com and when sending Kuri back to us, include all components of Kuri and original packaging. You bear the risk of loss during shipment. We therefore strongly recommend that you fully insure your return shipment against loss or damage and that you use a carrier that can provide you with proof of delivery for your protection. Refunds are processed within approximately the next two (2) billing cycles of your payment method statement from the date we receive your merchandise. Your refund will be credited back to the same payment method used to make the original Pre-Order Reservation. If we have not heard from you within three (3) years from the date on which we were to refund your payment method (assuming we determined that we could not timely ship or deliver Kuri), and we cannot locate you, you agree that any amounts paid pursuant to this Agreement shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of the California Unclaimed Property Law and we shall have no liability to you for any failure to refund such amounts.</p>

<p>Company warrants that Kuri will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use in accordance with Company’s published user documentation for one year from the date of your purchase (“Limited Warranty”). This Limited Warranty is only valid and enforceable in locations Kuri is sold and will apply only if you purchased Kuri from Company or its authorized resellers. This Limited Warranty only applies to hardware components of Kuri (and expressly excludes Kuri Software and any other software elements), and this Limited Warranty does not apply to damage caused by normal wear and tear, accidents, misuse (including any violation of Sections 2.D or 3 or a failure to follow product documentation), neglect, disassembly, alterations, servicing other than by Company authorized technicians, and external causes such as, but not limited to, water damage, anomalies in the electrical current supplied to the device, and extreme thermal or environmental conditions.

<p>If a defect arises and you return Kuri during the one-year Limited Warranty period, Company will in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by law either repair your Kuri device using new or refurbished parts, replace your Kuri device with a new or refurbished Kuri functionally at least equivalent to yours, or accept the return of your Kuri device in exchange for a refund of the purchase price you paid for it. If Company repairs or replaces Kuri, the repaired or replaced Kuri will continue to be warranted solely for the remaining time of the original warranty period. All returned parts for which you have received a replacement will become the property of Company. Nothing in this Limited Warranty will reduce or otherwise affect your statutory rights in relation to Kuri.</p>
<p>To make a claim under the Limited Warranty, please email our customer service department at support@heykuri.com with your name, contact information, and the serial number on the bottom of your Kuri, as well as a purchase receipt. If Company determines that the Limited Warranty claim is valid, Company will offer at no charge to you, packaging and shipping of Kuri in connection with such valid Limited Warranty claim.</p>
<p>THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 14 IS THE ONLY EXPRESS WARRANTY COMPANY PROVIDES FOR KURI, AND THE REMEDY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 14 IS YOUR SOLE REMEDY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, ARISING FROM COURSE OF CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING KURI, EXCEPT THAT ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE PERIOD OF THE EXPRESS WARRANTY ABOVE.</p>

<p>SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
<p><strong>16. GOVERNING LAW, ARBITRATION, AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER</strong></p>
<p>A. Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Santa Clara County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p>
<p>B. Arbitration. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM COMPANY. For any dispute with Company, you agree to first contact us at support@heykuri.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Company has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, Inc. (“JAMS”), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and Company agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Company from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of Company’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.</p>
<p>C. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.</p>
<p><strong>17. GENERAL</strong></p>
<p>A. Assignment. This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Company without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
<p>B. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement. Company may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our Websites or in the App, as determined by Company in our sole discretion. Company reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Company is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network or service provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. Company may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the ‘last updated’ date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service Agreement. If you do not agree to any of the terms of this Agreement or any future version of this Agreement, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.</p>
<p>C. Entire Agreement; Severability. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may have entered into or may enter into with Company in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Company concerning the Service and supersedes and cancels all previous agreements and communications (written or oral) relating to its subject matter. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.</p>
<p>D. No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Company’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<p>E. California Residents. If you are a California resident, in accordance with California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Sites of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Boulevard, Suite N 112 Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 or (916) 445-1254.</p>
<p>You can contact Company by mail at 400 Convention Way, Redwood City, California 94063, or by email at support@heykuri.com if you have a question or concern about any product or service we sell over the Internet.</p>
